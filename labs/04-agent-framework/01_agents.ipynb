    "In this notebook, we've explored how to build intelligent agents using Semantic Kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a Semantic Kernel environment with Azure OpenAI.\n",
    "2. Created kernel functions (tools) for agents to interact with external systems.\n",
    "3. Built specialized agents with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.\n",
    "4. Orchestrated multiple agents to collaboratively solve complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel agents provide a powerful framework for creating AI systems capable of reasoning, leveraging tools, and collaborating effectively to address complex problems. The Semantic Kernel agent framework simplifies the development, testing, and deployment of these intelligent systems.\n",
