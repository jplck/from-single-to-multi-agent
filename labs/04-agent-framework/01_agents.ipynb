      "On June 15, 2023, at latitude 48.137154 and longitude 11.576124 (Munich, Germany), the seasonal factors influence PV production as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Day length: 14.2 hours — This is near the summer solstice, so days are long, allowing solar panels to generate electricity for more hours.\n",
      "- Sun angle: 65.3° — The sun is high in the sky, resulting in more direct sunlight on PV modules, which increases their efficiency and power output.\n",
      "- Seasonal factor: 0.92 — This means PV production is at 92% of its theoretical annual maximum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "During late spring and early summer, the combination of long days and high sun angles means solar panels receive abundant, direct sunlight. This results in strong PV generation, with only slight reductions from perfect conditions due to atmospheric effects or weather variability. Thus, PV output is excellent during this period.\n",

      "- Elevation: 519 meters above sea level\n",
      "\n",
      "How Munich’s Location Affects Solar Energy Potential:\n",
      "- The relatively high latitude results in long daylight hours in June (about 14.2 hours), but the sun’s maximum angle—at 65.3°, lower than the tropics—means sunlight is slightly less direct.\n",
      "- The elevation (519 m) may help slightly due to thinner air (less atmospheric attenuation).\n",
      "- Seasonal adjustment factor is 0.92, meaning irradiance is strong but not quite at peak (mainly due to some atmospheric conditions typical in early summer).\n",
      "\n",
      "Weather Conditions on June 15, 2023:\n",
      "- Predicted cloud cover is low (20%), with high solar irradiance (800 W/m²) and temperature of 25°C—very favorable for PV output.\n",

      "- Panel Type: Monocrystalline (high efficiency, 22.0%)\n",
      "- Orientation: South, Tilt: 30°—both optimal for this latitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expected PV Production Estimate:\n",
      "1. Irradiance (800 W/m²), multiplied by average daylight (14.2 hours), results in roughly 11.36 kWh/m² for the day.\n",
      "2. A typical system with your specifications would convert about 22% of this to electricity. Taking system losses (inverter, cabling, temperature effect) into account (estimating total system loss of ~12%):\n",
      "   - Effective efficiency ≈ 19.4%\n",
      "3. For a 5.0 kW (nominal) system:\n",
      "   - Daily production = System Size × Peak Sun Hours × Efficiency Factor × Seasonal Factor\n",
